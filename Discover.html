								The Universe is everything but a small place. Getting out is something that has to be done: just like a little boy experiences the world, walking, grabbing, tasting and venturing to the unknown (because technically it’s all unknown) we as a species must explore the universe and get to know this enigmatic place in which this planet we’re happy to call home rides along. And if we happen to burn incredible amounts of fuel and look cool in the process, well... that’s just a plus.

								Sometimes it is argued that exploration is a waste of money, that we could use that money towards better a nobler goals like... world peace? Actually, exploration funding kind of works towards the achievement of this very same goal. The International Space station is occupied by astronauts from several nations and was built by several nations working together.

								It is true that there’s a USA flag on the moon, but it is also true that Neil Armstrong said “that’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” making all of us instantly part of this adventure.

								Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company developed a fibrous material, five times stronger than , for NASA to use in parachute shrouds to soft-land the Viking Lander spacecraft on the Martian surface. Recognizing the durability of the material, Goodyear expanded the technology and went on to produce a new radial tire with a tread life expected to be 10,000 miles (16,000 km) greater than conventional radials.

								So yeah, this is just one of many examples of how exploration has impacted our daily lives, did you know NASA also worked with NESTLE?

								Cellphones, (which to most people seem to be a necessity nowadays) simply wouldn’t be possible without them.

								The world’s first artificial satellite, the Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Since then, thousands of satellites have been launched into orbit around the Earth. Some satellites, notably space stations, have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit.

								Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites,communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites.

								Who would’ve thought that something so simple could help in so many different ways? The work on applying light-emitting diodes in NASA space shuttle plant growth experiments leads to the development of a hand-held, high-intensity, LED unit developed by Quantum Devices Inc. Light-emitting diodes for medical purposes were inducted into the Space Foundation’s Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2000.

								Blue LED light has various positive effects on the body. It can, for example, relieve pain. Light therapy or phototherapy (classically referred to as heliotherapy) consists of exposure to daylight or to specific wavelengths of light using lasers, light-emitting diodes, fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps or very bright, full-spectrum light, usually controlled with various devices. The light is administered for a prescribed amount of time and, in some cases, at a specific time of day.

								Cleaner energy: the road towards a healthier planet. The advanced technology behind these solar devices—which provide up to 50% more power than conventional solar cells—originated with the efforts of a NASA-sponsored 28-member coalition forming the Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) Alliance.

								Water is life, if there’s one thing we know about life is it needs water. Whether we want to survive in space or here on earth, . NASA engineers are collaborating with qualified companies to develop systems intended to sustain the astronauts living on the International Space Station and future Moon and space missions. This system turns wastewater from respiration, sweat, and urine into drinkable water. Commercially, this system is benefiting people all over the world who need affordable, clean water, especially in remote locations. By combining the benefits of chemical adsorption, ion exchange, and ultra-filtration processes, this technology can yield safe, drinkable water from the most challenging sources, such as in underdeveloped regions where well water may be heavily contaminated.

					Space is the coolest thing we’ve known since we were kids and Astronauts were better than
					Rockstars. This is childish, of course, but we also understand that exploration brings a lot of
					benefits with it, such as development, self awareness, among others. Exploration is more than
					just space though... we should look into exploring the ocean floor also, and constantly work on
					the development of solutions for the problems we can grasp. Science is a good investment...
					science was and always will be - the future -

					Why do you think we explore? What are you exploring? How can we explore together? Share
					your thoughts with us here!
